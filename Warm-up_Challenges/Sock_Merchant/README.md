### Pseudocode

1.  Instantiate an object to keep track of the socks and the number of occurencies.
2.  Count the number of occurences of each sock
3.  Get an array of the values
4.  create an empty array to store the number of multiple
5.  Initialize the sum of pairs to zero
6.  add multiples to the multiple array
7.  Math.floor to check for odd numbers (i.e if you have 3 or 5 socks, you want a pair of two, and discard the single)
8.  Finally return the sum of pairs
9.  Finally return the sum of pairs
